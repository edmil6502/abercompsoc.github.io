# Introduction
It's an aberCompSoc tradition to try to make the trip to FOSDEM annually, though this year we were a little worried it wouldn't happen at all! Whilst in previous years the university and the BCS were able to provide financial support (typically used for transport, etc.) this year we were unable to secure funding. As such, we had to partially call the trip off, as we could not guarantee transport.

Nevertheless, we still continued in a less formal, structured capacity - people just had to make their own travel arrangements. Most of us stayed together in the [Sleep Well](https://sleepwell.be/index.php/en/) youth hostel, as we'd had a good experience with it last year, and a couple others sorted their own accommodation (with one group staying in the Netherlands and driving to FOSDEM both days - bit of a trek!).

# What did we get up to?
## Friday
We arrived in Brussels on Friday, and were all a little weary/delerious from travelling. Nevertheless, our tourist overrides kicked in, and we got some exploring done. We had a little wander around Brussels, and went to the [Musical Instruments Museum](https://www.mim.be/en) for a few hours. Tickets were pretty cheap (student discount, too!) and we spent a good couple hours in there. Later on, we went to [Kabuki](https://www.restaurant-kabuki.be/en/restaurant-kabuki-in-brussels-japanese-quality-cuisine/), an all-you-can-eat sushi-restaurant - and yes, they have the little carousel thing! It's about €20 for the buffet, and €30 for the carousel, but it IS all-you-can-eat. Right next door to that was the [Museum of Infinite Realities](https://www.museumofinfiniterealities.com/en), which was an interesting experience - a light show and something about spirit animals. It was about €20 to get in, and the whole thing took about an hour. Personally, that was the longest hour of my life, but a fair few (admittedly more open-minded) folks had a good time!
